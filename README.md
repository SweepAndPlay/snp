Firstly, get the best component that you need. Develop the mobile application in order to have a gamepad to play with, and transmit commands by Bluetooth communication (Android Studio). At the same time develop an IP on the FPGA to get the information from the Bluetooth shield and another one IP for NFC shield (VIVADO). Then, program a simple game like Brick Breaker or Pong and implement them in the FPGA. After then implement the HDMI display controller. Finally, you only need to display it on screen. Enjoy the game.
